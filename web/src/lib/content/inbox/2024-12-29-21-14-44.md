# How to Think Like a Developer

This guide provides a framework for developing a developer's mindset through practical steps and project work.

1. **Introduction**: Many new developers feel lost after learning the basics. It's important to recognize that learning takes time and practice.

2. **Disillusion**: Tutorials can set unrealistic expectations. Avoid comparing yourself to others; focus on your own progress.

3. **Projects**: Create a to-do app as a foundational project to practice coding skills.

4. **Breaking Down Problems**: Approach problems systematically. Break them down into manageable components, such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) tasks.

5. **Getting Started**: Use tools like CodePen or Github Codespaces to experiment without the pressure of setting up a local environment.

6. **Understanding User Input and Data Structures**: Learn to capture user input effectively and think in terms of data structuresâ€”like an array of todo objects.

7. **Wishful Thinking and Pseudocode**: Use "wishful thinking" to conceptualize functions before coding, and write pseudocode to outline your logic.

8. **CRUD Operations**: Implement features to create, update, and delete todos, focusing first on functionality before refining the code.

9. **Styling**: Styling should be the last thing to work on.

10. **Finding Project Ideas**: Explore resources for project ideas to build confidence and experience.

11. **Reading Documentation and Seeking Help**: Embrace documentation as a learning tool, and don't hesitate to ask for help in communities.

12. **Conclusion**: Understanding comes from doing. Break tasks down, practice consistently, and focus on working code rather than perfection.

This guide should encourage developers to embrace the learning journey, build projects, and continuously seek knowledge and improvement.
