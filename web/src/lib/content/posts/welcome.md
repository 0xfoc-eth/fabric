**Improve the styling. Butt first, the functionality**

<textarea class="text-primary-800" placeholder="Get started creating notes now!" />

This is the first post of your new blog, powered by [SvelteKit](/posts/getting-started), [Obsidian](/obsidian), and [Fabric](/about). I'm excited to share this project with you, and I hope you find it useful for your own writing and experiences.

This part of the application is edited in <a href="http://localhost:5173/posts/obsidian" name="Obsidian">Obsidian</a>.
