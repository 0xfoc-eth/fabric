# The Fabric Web App
[Installing](#Installing)|[Todos](#Todos)|[Collaborators](#Collaborators)

This is a web app for Fabric. It was built using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [SkeletonUI](https://skeleton.dev/), and [Mdsvex](https://mdsvex.pngwn.io/). 

The goal of this app is to not only provide a user interface for Fabric, but also a out-of-the-box website for those who want to get started with web development, blogging, or to just have a web interface for fabric. You can use this app as a GUI interface for Fabric, a ready to go blog-site, or a website template for your own projects.
